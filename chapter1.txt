The splendor before my eyes left me breathless, a vaulted ceiling painted with scenes from an ancient tale; tapestries that stretched across three walls depicting tales of heroes long dead.
However, as fate would have it, I was thoroughly distracted by the flurry of magic explosions obliterating my vision every time a magic spell hit its target: the dragon. After all, I was a mere human in the company of two magical beings, my companion Galena, a witch, and a fearsome crystal dragon. My presence here was not only an honor but also a grave danger.
"You know what to do, right?!" Galena shouted at me as she threw another fireball at the dragon's head.
I had been tasked with assisting Galena on this quest to save the world from the evil of a dragon. But how could I possibly help? 
As I watched the two combatants dance across the floor, trading blows and countering each other, I was struck by the sheer magnitude of power that they both wielded.
"Don't just stand there! Get the amulet!" Galena shouted at me as she flung a bolt of lightning from her fingertips.
I was shocked into action by her command, but then, just as suddenly, I realized that I had no idea where to start looking. There was no sign of the dragon's treasure, no hoard of gold and jewels and ancient artifacts.
Galena fired another blast of lightning, this one hitting the dragon squarely on its chest. The creature let out a roar and then charged at her. She quickly raised her hand, and a shield appeared between them.
I stood frozen in place, not knowing what to do next.
