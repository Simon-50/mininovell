"Come on! Don't just stand there! We don't have time for this!"
I finally managed to snap myself out of my stupor and rushed toward the dragon's nest, a large pile of dirt, stones, and bones in the center of the cave.
I quickly rummaged through the mound and found the dragon's hoard of gold and jewels hidden within. I picked up the amulet, which was a golden circle set with an orange jewel, and held it tightly in my hand.
"Hurry!" Galena yelled at me again.
I ran back to her side, holding the amulet high above my head.
She waved her hands, and the amulet floated up into the air, then began to glow brightly.
